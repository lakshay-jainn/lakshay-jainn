### Skills & Expertise

- **AI Engineering:** Working with open-source LLMs, LangChain pipelines, vector embeddings, and retrieval-augmented systems. Experience in **deploying and optimizing LLMs for real use**, not just research notebooks.
- **Backend & Systems:** FastAPI / Flask API development, Postgres/Prisma workflows, Dockerized deployments, async processing, API integrations.
- **Data Science:** Data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, visualization, feature engineering, model training & evaluation.
- **Foundations:** Strong understanding of **probability, statistics**, and the math behind ML models.

---

### Current Focus
- Building **real-world AI systems**, especially involving LLM agents and data workflows.
- Backend architecture for **scalable, reliable AI deployment**.
- Deepening understanding of **model internals** (not treating models as black boxes).
- Improving the **Cell Slide Medical Annotation System** with doctor feedback.

---

### Project Highlights

- **Medical Cell-Slide Annotation Platform (In Use by Doctors):**  
  Built to assist pneumonologists and pathologists during procedures. The goal is to reduce the need for mid-surgery pathology consultations by enabling quicker cell identification on the spot, ultimately reducing surgery time and improving decision-making.

  - Backend: https://github.com/lakshay-jainn/cell-annotation-backend
  
- **Open Source Model Deployments:**
<br>Deployed an open source fine-tuned Yolo Model, which detects the cell nuclei from a medical cell slide. Converting a command line inference model, to product Deployed API using Flask. 
  - Code: https://huggingface.co/spaces/lakshayjain2233/my-mldel/tree/main
  - Model: https://github.com/impromptuRong/hd_ws
- **SafeSpace:**
<br>Anonymous posting platform with **AI-powered comment moderation**. A real-time pipeline scores toxicity, hate/harassment, and self-harm signals using open-source models, then auto-hides or flags comments while allowing moderator review and user appeals.
  - Code: https://github.com/lakshay-jainn/Safe-Space-full-stack
  
- **Neural Network from Scratch (MNIST Classifier):**  
  Achieved **90.6% accuracy**, deriving gradients and implementing training loops entirely from scratch.

- **Alumni Connect:** React + Express.js full-stack collaboration platform.
